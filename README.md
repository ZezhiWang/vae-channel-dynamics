# vae-channel-dynamics
This project investigates the phenomenon of emergent channel inactivity ("dead regions") in the SDXL VAE model. The goal is to track the appearance of these regions during training, classify them, and potentially intervene ("nudge" inactive channels) to understand their impact on model performance and behaviour..
